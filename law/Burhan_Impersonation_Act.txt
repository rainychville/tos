            Burhan Impersonation Act

        

        AN ACT to prevent in perpetuity any method
        of impersonating BurhanCheese, in response
        to the Burhan identity crisis which
        occured in October 2021.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SEC 1. GENERAL
    (1) No person, in any context that may include the self-identification 
     of a sapient entity or a group that consists entirely of sapient
     entities by a name or colloquial identifier, use the following
     names/identifiers ``Burhan``, ``BurhanCheese``, or any terms that may
     be confused with the two aforementioned identifiers, such as a
     nickname, publicly known codename, or other identifier, including
     typos/grammar mistakes without the verifiable permission of Burhan
     or the Moderation Team. This section shall not apply to Discord
     discriminators, user IDs on websites, or any other location outside
     of the jurisdiction of the Rainychville  Government.
    (2) The penalty for any violation of section 1 of this section shall be
     at minimum a formal warning from the Server Staff, and at maximum a
     permanent ban from the Rainychville Discord.
SEC 2. Enforcement
    (1) At any time, any methods which can verifiably detect violations of
     this Act may be utilized for enforcement. Such methods include but
     are not limited to:
        (a) regular expressions, commonly known as regex, used to perform
         operations on strings, including but not limited to:
            (i) manipulation of strings, such as altering them based on
             their context;
            (ii) finding words or strings;
            (iii) and find and replace operations, where matches to a given
             string are then subjected to string manipulation;
        (b) Sørensen–Dice coefficient calculation, where the similarity
         of two samples such as any identifier used by BurhanCheese
         and the current identifier of the person believed or
         percieved to have impersonated BurhanCheese;
        (c) manual investigation of both names by any sapient entity
         with sufficient knowledge of human culture, or the rules
         and regulations of the Rainychville Discord, who shall have
         the authority to report such violations to the Moderation
         Team;
        (d) and BurhanCheese themselves, who may at their will inform
         the Moderation Team of any perceived violations.
SEC 3. VERIFICATION OF BURHANCHEESE IDENTITY.
    (1) At any time, the identity of BurhanCheese may be verified by
     several methods, including but not limited to:
        (a) password verification on Discord where the password is salted
         and hashed or otherwise handled securely in accordance with
         their internal policy;
        (b) verification of identity based on heuristics and message
         typing patterns, direct answers to any questions asked by the
         Community so long as the questions:
            (i) are not inappropriate or intentionally paradoxical;
            (ii) or deliberately worded as to be impossible to answer properly.
