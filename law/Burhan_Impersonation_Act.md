### Article I. General

#### Restrictions of the use of the term "Burhan", etc.

1. No person, in any context that may include the self-identification
   of a sapient entity or a group that consists entirely of sapient
   entities by a name or colloquial identifier, use the following
   names/identifiers *Burhan*, *BurhanCheese*, or any terms that may
   be confused with the two aforementioned identifiers, such as a
   nickname, publicly known codename, or other identifier, including
   typos/grammar mistakes without the verifiable permission of Burhan
   or the Moderation Team.

    - This section shall not apply to Discord discriminators, user IDs
    on websites, or any other location outside of the jurisdiction of
    the Rainychville Government.

2. The penalty for any violation of section 1 of this section shall be
   at minimum a formal warning from the Server Staff, and at maximum
   a permanent ban from the Rainychville Discord.



#### Enforcement

1. At any time, any methods which can verifiably detect violations of
   this Act may be utilized for enforcement. Such methods include but
   are not limited to:

      - regular expressions, commonly known as regex, used to perform
        operations on strings, including but not limited to:
        
         - manipulation of strings, such as altering them based on
           their context;

         - finding words or strings;

         - and find and replace operations, where matches to a given
           string are then subjected to string manipulation;
      
      - Sørensen–Dice coefficient calculation, where the similarity
        of two samples such as any identifier used by BurhanCheese
        and the current identifier of the person believed or
        percieved to have impersonated BurhanCheese;
      
      - manual investigation of both names by any sapient entity
        with sufficient knowledge of human culture, or the rules
        and regulations of the Rainychville Discord, who shall have
        the authority to report such violations to the Moderation
        Team;
      
      - and BurhanCheese themselves, who may at their will inform
        the Moderation Team of any perceived violations.



#### Verification of BurhanCheese's identity

1. At any time, the identity of BurhanCheese may be verified by
   several methods, including but not limited to:
   
   - password verification on Discord where the password is salted
     and hashed or otherwise handled securely in accordance with
     their internal policy;

   - verification of identity based on heuristics and message
     typing patterns, direct answers to any questions asked by the
     Community so long as the questions:
     
     - are not inappropriate or intentionally paradoxical;

     - or deliberately worded as to be impossible to answer properly.
