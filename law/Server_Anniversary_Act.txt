SEC 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This act may be cited as the Server Anniversary Act.
SEC 2. PUBLIC HOLIDAY REQUIREMENTS
    (1) On September 25, each Gregorian calendar year, reasonable effort must
     be made by the moderation staff of the Server to ensure that;
        (1) The server's culture, heritage, and intangible works are
         celebrated, preserved, and looked back on;
        (2) There is a safe environment to celebrate the Anniversary and
         related events by ensuring the complete non-presence of persons
         considered to pose a serious threat to the Server;
        (3) Rainych music is played at a volume no lower than 70
         decibels (dB), in at least one (1) location anywhere on Earth or any
         other inhabited location by humans outside of Earth (e.g the
         International Space Station) where:
            (1) there is an atmosphere that can serve as a medium for sound
             waves to pass into people's ears;
            (2) the playing of said music is permissible by noise-related
             regulations, the collective consensus of nearby residents, the
             wisdom of Rainych herself, or any combination of the two.
SEC 3. SINGING CONTEST.
    (1) Shall the moderators of Rainychville choose to host a "singing
     contest", where participants must submit recordings of themselves
     performing a cover of a song, the moderators or relevant event
     organization staff shall:
        (1) if necessary, cite the provisions of the Rainychville Talents Act
         as guidelines or provide a "plain text" or readable summary;
        (2) archive and make accessible to Rainychville members recordings of
         all submissions:
            (1) in file formats that are accessible; and
            (2) with no encryption; and
            (3) without any digital rights management technology which may
             restrict the distribution, modification, or playback of the
             musical contents of the file.
