 ECIR 12.1.355.6 "Server Anniversary Act"


    I.   Preamble

        This act shall define a new Public Holiday within the
        jurisdiction of the Rainych Space called "Rainychville Day"
        which shall take place every Gregorian calendar year
        on the Gregorian date of September 25.

    II.  Public Holiday Requirements

        2001. On September 25, each Gregorian calendar year,
              reasonable effort must be made by the
              moderation staff of the Server to ensure that;

                a. The server's culture, heritage, and
                   intangible works are celebrated,
                   preserved, and looked back on;
                b. There is a safe environment to
                   celebrate the Anniversary and related
                   events by ensuring the complete non-presence
                   of persons considered to pose a serious threat
                   to the Server;

                c. Rainych music is played at a volume no lower
                   than 70 decibels (dB), in at least one (1)
                   location anywhere on Earth or any other
                   inhabited location by humans outside
                   of Earth (e.g the International Space Station)
                   where:
                     i. there is an atmosphere that can serve
                        as a medium for sound waves to pass into
                        people's ears;

                     ii. the playing of said music is permissible
                         by noise-related regulations, the
                         collective consensus of nearby residents,
                         the wisdom of Rainych herself, or any
                         combination of the two.

        2002. A suitable index of all Singing Contest submissions
              submitted during a Holiday Period if applicable
              shall be drafted by any competent third party.

        2003. In addition, the Rainychville Terms of Service must
              be enforced alongside the Server Anniversary Act.
