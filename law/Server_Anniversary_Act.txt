SEC 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This act may be cited as the Server Anniversary Act.
SEC 2. PUBLIC HOLIDAY REQUIREMENTS
    (1) On September 25, each Gregorian calendar year, reasonable effort must
     be made by the moderation staff of the Server to ensure that;
        (1) The server's culture, heritage, and intangible works are
         celebrated, preserved, and looked back on;
        (2) There is a safe environment to celebrate the Anniversary and
         related events by ensuring the complete non-presence of persons
         considered to pose a serious threat to the Server;
        (3) Rainych music is played at a volume no lower than 70
         decibels (dB), in at least one (1) location anywhere on Earth or any
         other inhabited location by humans outside of Earth (e.g the
         International Space Station) where:
            (1) there is an atmosphere that can serve as a medium for sound
             waves to pass into people's ears;
            (2) the playing of said music is permissible by noise-related
             regulations, the collective consensus of nearby residents, the
             wisdom of Rainych herself, or any combination of the two.
    (2) A suitable index of all Singing Contest submissions submitted during a
     Holiday Period if applicable shall be drafted by any competent third
     party.
    (3) In addition, the Rainychville Terms of Service must be enforced
     alongside the Server Anniversary Act.
