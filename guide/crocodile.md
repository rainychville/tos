# Rainychville crocodile
**Rainychville crocodiles** are large semiaquatic reptiles endemic to
Rainychville. Male instances of Rainychville crocodiles often prey on
female humans, and have been observed to flirt with them. It is unknown
how Rainychville crocodiles reproduce, as female instances have never
been spotted since their discovery in 1833.
