# Law clause citation format

To cite provisions of Rainychville law, there is a recommended format for
such. This format is used in commit messages to be concise (as it is best
practice to keep Git commit messages under 50 characters).

The format is as follows: `12.1.355.X/XXXX`, where `X` is the number of
the law (Rainychville TOS is at `12.1.355.1`.), and `XXXX` the clause
number, separated by dots.

This example will be used, and this document assumes that this example
is stored under `12.1.355.x-0`.
```
SEC 1. GENERAL.
    (1) You shall not:
        (1) pass.
    (2) One does not simply:
        (1) walk into Mordor; or
        (2) insult Rainych.
```

The provision of this example stating that one does not simply walk
into Mordor, can be cited as `12.1.355.x-0/1.2.1`, where `1.2.1` is
the clause number. The first `1` refers to Section 1, titled
"General". The `2` refers to clause 2 of Section 1, which says
`(2) One does not simply:`, and the final `1` refers to `1.2`'s
first subprovision, `(1) walk into Mordor; or`.

This dot notation can be expanded further depending on how deep
the provisions of a law get. Now an exception was added to
`12.1.355.x-0/1.2.2`, saying that you can insult Rainych as long
as your criticism is constructive (i.e telling her how she could
have improved on a cover), so now the document looks like this.
```
SEC 1. GENERAL.
    (1) You shall not:
        (1) pass.
    (2) One does not simply:
        (1) walk into Mordor; or
        (2) insult Rainych, except where:
            (1) the criticism is constructive.
```

The exception to insulting Rainych can be cited as
`12.1.355.x-0/1.2.2.1`.

Essentially, after `/`, the clause number is essentially the location
of the clause, in the hierarchy of the law's clauses, with levels
denoted by the `.` character and indentation in the actual text
of the law itself.
