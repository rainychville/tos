# Script data

For the purposes of automation, this directory contains several
files in machine-readable data formats about the laws of
Rainychville.

> **Warning**: All machine-readable data formats use
> forward slashes (used on Linux, macOS and other
> Unix-like systems), instead of backward slashes used
> by Windows.

Filepaths are relative to the project root directory, meaning 
if you downloaded this repository, and placed it on your
computer, in `C:\Users\USER\RainychvilleTOS`, if `laws.json`
specified `/RainychvilleTOS.txt`, it is specifying
`C:\Users\USER\RainychvilleTOS\RainychvilleTOS.txt`.
