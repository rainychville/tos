                RAINYCHVILLE STORY SUBMISSION
                "RandomFan#3511's Rainychville Story"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was on 6 April 2021 that the server would receieve a new member,
RandomFan#3511. He was a chill person, who would chat in the server, but
sometime around June 2021 he would make something that forever changed the
way he involved himself with the server.

What he just did was create the Rainychville TOS. He wanted to make fun of the
long TOS documents that the big companies always wanted you to read before
signing up for their services. So he wrote one.

People laughed very much about it and he felt happy with his invention. Now,
for some Rainychville lore, perhaps.


            -- 2021 Burhan Impersonation Crisis --

    The 2021 Burhan Impersonation Crisis was a time of crisis
    for our server. People pretended to be BurhanCheese. The
    communication networks of our server collapsed into nothingness
    in the chaos, as we all tried to find the real Burhan.

    We don't know who started all this, but whoever it was, it was
    someone who wanted to watch our great server burn. For their
    own pleasure. Perhaps.
